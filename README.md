## Portfolio Overview
### [Practical Machine Learning](https://github.com/serrauzun/NorthwesternMSDS_Portfolio/tree/main/Practical%20Machine%20Learning)
#### Home Equity Line of Credit
The project involved conducting unsupervised learning method like Principal Component Analysis and k-Means Clustering, followed by numerous supervised learning models such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear and Logistic Regression and Neural Networks (Tensor Flow) to predict the probability of default credit and loss amount assuming loan defaults. Finally ran a ROC comparison between three based, regression and NN to determine optimal model. Achieved over 95% accuracy in loan default and loss amount predictions.

#### [Image Recognition with Fashion MNIST data](https://github.com/serrauzun/NorthwesternMSDS_Portfolio/tree/main/Practical%20Machine%20Learning/TensorFlow)
Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total. The project required to build a computer vision model using keras that will predict the label class of the item of clothing through the image with approximately 90% accuracy.
